## About The Project

![captcha example](images/captcha-example.png)

This type of captcha is very similar to the captcha in [MathCaptchaSolver](https://github.com/AmireNoori/MathCaptchaSolver) main branch.
So if you want to know more about the details of the project, refer to this link:

[MathCaptchaSolver](https://github.com/AmireNoori/MathCaptchaSolver)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AmireNoori/MathCaptchaSolver-v2
   ```

You must have installed `transformers`, `opencv-python` and `numpy` libraries. For this, you can install each of them separately or install this tool using the `requirements.txt` file by entering the following command in the terminal.

2. Install packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This tool is written in the form of a library that you can easily import and use in your robot or program.

* An example of how to use :

_Create a `main.py` file and enter the following codes in it._

* Example
  ```sh
  from MathCaptchaSolver import CaptchaSolver
  solver = CaptchaSolver('Your captcha Image path') # Enter captcha Image path
  result = solver.solve_captcha()
  print(result)
  ```
* Terminal
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```

_Note: When you run the program for the first time, your system must be connected to the Internet to download the model from the Hugging Face website and it may take some time to run the program for the first time._
